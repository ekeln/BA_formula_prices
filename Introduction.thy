chapter \<open>Introduction\<close>
text \<open>In this thesis, I show the corrspondence between various equivalences popular in the reactive
systems community and and coordinates of a price function, as introduced by Benjamin Bisping (citation).
I formalised the concepts and proofs discussed in this thesis in the interactive proof assistant Isabelle (citation).

- Reactive Systmes \\
  - what are they \\
  - modelling (via lts etc) \\
  - Semantics of resysts \\
    - Verification \\
    - different notions of equivalence (because of nondeteminism?) -> van glabbeek \\
    - Different definitions of semantics -> HML/relational/... \\
 --> linear-time--branching-time spectrum understood through properties of HML \\
  --> capture expressiveness capabilities of HML formulas via a function \\
--> Contribution o Paper: The in (citation) introduced expressiveness function 
and its coordinates captures the linear time branching time spectrum.. \\
- Isabelle:\\
  - formalization of concepts, proofs \\
  - what is isabelle \\
  - difference between mathematical concepts and their implementation? \\
